            <p>I'm a passionate front-end developer with a strong focus on creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. I specialize in building with React, translating designs into functional, mobile-first interfaces. With experience in version control (Git/Github) and deployment platforms like Netlify, I enjoy turning ideas into real-world digital experiences. I'm continuously learning and refining my skills to deliver fast, accessible, and modern web applications</p>
